# Nailing Machine Learning Interviews

Go through these notes and frequently asked questions to nail your next machine learning interview :)
 

#### Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning?

In supervised learning the machine learns a ***function that maps between *X* (all the features, or input) and *Y* (label, or output)***, so that it can make prediction on new data - given unseen X, predict its Y. For example, given the subject line, text body, and senders' email address, we can train machines to classify whether the a new email is a spam or not.

On the other hand, in unsupervised learning there is ***no label given, so machines have to learn and discover patterns from data itself (without human supervision)***. One example is that given user related data, such as their location, browsing history, and logged times (during the past 12 hrs, 24 hrs, 3 days, 1 week, etc.), the machine would learn to cluster users into different groups (which can be useful for target marketing, for instance).

So in a nutshell - supervised: supervise/teach machines to make prediction; unsupervised: "dear machine, I trust you, discover some hidden patterns for me on your own"
