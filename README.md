# Nailing Machine Learning Interviews

Go through these notes and frequently asked questions to nail your next machine learning interview :)
 

**Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning?**

In supervised learning the machine learns a function that maps between **X** (all the features, or input) and **Y** (label, or output), so that it can make prediction on new data. For example, given the subject line, text body, and senders' email address, machines can learn to classify whether the email is a spam or not.

On the other hand, in unsupervised learning there is no label given, and machines have to learn and discover patterns from unlabelled data. One example is that given user related data, such as their location, browsing history, and logged times (during the past 12 hrs, 24 hrs, 3 days, 1 week, etc.), the machine would learn to cluster them into different groups (which can be used for more targetted marketing, for example).

So in a nutshell - supervised: "supervise" or teach machines to make prediction; unsupervised: dear machine, I trust you, discover some hidden patterns for me on your own
