# Nailing Machine Learning Concepts

This work in progress repo is designed to help you get familiar with ***machine learning, both the concepts and its operationalization (MLOps)***.

You can use this repo to ***prepare for machine learning and data science interviews***. If you have interviews coming up then you may spend some time going through the topics and answers I provided. Make sure you understand all the topics and can explain them well.

Let's get started!!!
